| controller          | _empty_             | controller URL for Enterprise installations       |

> [!TIP]
> For the Runway CLI version, `latest` is fine. We strive to never break your workflows. But sometimes BC breaks are necessary. Because they usually involve our client and APIs, using `latest` helps to keep all interruptions to a minimum.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There's a BC break in this action** in `v0.5.0`, previously the `public-key` and `private-key` inputs contained paths. They have been renamed to `public-key-location` and `private-key-location` to make their purpose more clear. The _new_ `public-key` and `private-key` inputs are optional and contain your (SSH) public and private key if used.

## Examples

The following examples show how this action and the Runway CLI can be used in workflows.

### Deployments

This is an example workflow which shows Runway CLI setup and then how to use the CLI to deploy your application `cool-app`.

Once the CLI is setup, you can run all commands and play around with output and so on. To keep it simple, we're only deploying the code. :) Since the application exists already on Runway we use the `runway gitremote` command to initialize the setup.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: release

on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: cool-app
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 # this is important
    - uses: hostwithquantum/setup-runway@v0.5.0
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.RUNWAY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.RUNWAY_PASSWORD }}
        application: ${{ env.APPLICATION_NAME }}
        private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
        public-key: ${{ secrets.PUBLIC_KEY }}
    - run: runway app deploy
    - run: runway logout
```

### Creating applications

When you invoke this action with an `application` input, we'll either create or attach an existing application with that name. By default we create an application on the free tier, but if you need to customize the `runway app create`, then skip the `application` input and do this instead in a regular `run` step.

This examples creates an application on the [Pro Plan](https://www.runway.horse/pricing/) with persistence enabled:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on: pull_request

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: hostwithquantum/setup-runway@v0.5.0
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
          public-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PUBLIC_KEY }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - run: |
          runway app create \
            -a my-fancy-name \
            -p pro-m-launch \
            --persistence
```

### Running e2e tests

GitHub Actions provides a robust and comprehensive environment to run e2e tests and here's how Runway can help:

The following workflow leverages some of the context in form of `${{ github.run_id }}`. We'll use this _identifier_ to deploy an application with a unique name. Another viable option is to use the pull-requests's number: `${{ github.event.number }}`.

Once deployed, you can run end-to-end tests against it and in the end, shut it down by deleting the application (and key). :) If you decide to keep the application to have a preview available, you may also do that.

> [!TIP]
> If you plan to use this feature with e.g. dependabot, then ensure to add the appropriate secrets for dependabot on your repository settings.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
name: e2e

on: pull_request

jobs:
  deploy_app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 # this is important!
    - name: create an ssh key just for this run
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh/
        ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/test-runner -c "test-key-${{ github.run_id }}" -q -N ""
    - name: install Runway CLI, login and add ssh key
      uses: hostwithquantum/setup-runway@v0.5.0
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.RUNWAY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.RUNWAY_PASSWORD }}
        application: my-app-${{ github.run_id }}
        public-key-location: ~/.ssh/test-runner.pub
        private-key-location: ~/.ssh/test-runner
        add-key: true
        setup-ssh: true
    - name: deploy your application to Runway
      run: runway app deploy
    # this is where your tests run!
    - name: run your e2e tests here
      run: curl https://my-app-${{ github.run_id }}.pqapp.dev/
    # then hopefully you are done :)
    - name: cleanup application
      if: always()
      run : runway app rm -a my-app-${{ github.run_id }} || true
    - name: cleanup key - this is brute force
      if: always()
      run: runway key rm "test-key-${{ github.run_id }}" || true
    - name: logout
      if: always()
      run: runway logout
```

### Preview apps

In the previous example, we created an application to run our tests. But another great use-case are preview-apps â€” they allow you to create a demo of your changes.

The following workflow shows how to deletes an application from Runway when a pull-request is closed (merged or closed without merge).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example _assumes_ that you constructed the application with a stable identifier, e.g. `my-app-${{ github.event.number }}` (instead of `github.run_id`). In a pull request context, the `${{ github.event.number }}` is the ID of the pull request.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/delete-preview.yml
name: delete app

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  delete:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: hostwithquantum/setup-runway@v0.5.0
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.QUANTUM_RUNWAY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.QUANTUM_RUNWAY_PASSWORD }}
    - run: runway app rm my-app-${{ github.event.number }}
    - if: always()
      run: runway logout
```
